# Work-day-scheduler

## Description
This is a calendar which has a list of standard work ours from 9AM-5PM to outline your schedule for the day.

## Usage
You can write notes in each hour and the time blocks will be colored depending on what time it is. If a time block is red, it's the current time, if it's gray, then it's in the past, and if it's green, then it's in the future. You can save whatever you type in each time block and it's saved in local storage.
